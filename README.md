# Cansat-Role-Senario-Freertos-CMSIS-V2

This repository showcases **real embedded engineering** ‚Äî not just code, but **architecture, design hierarchy, and process discipline**.  
It‚Äôs about how to structure systems, handle concurrency, and manage communication between independent processes.  

We‚Äôre living in the **AI age**, and writing code is no longer the challenge ‚Äî building **robust, maintainable, and scalable systems** is.  
This project represents that philosophy through the development of a **FreeRTOS-based telemetry and control system**, 
inspired by **CANSAT role scenarios** ‚Äî where real-time sensor acquisition, communication, and control come together in a unified embedded platform.

All shared code is for **educational and reference purposes** only.  
Please do not copy or reuse without understanding the context.

# üõ∞Ô∏è RTOS-Based Telemetry and Control System

A **FreeRTOS-based embedded system** designed for real-time telemetry, sensor fusion, and command execution using **STM32 microcontrollers**.  
It integrates multiple sensors and a **LoRa E22 communication module** for reliable wireless telemetry and control.

## üß© Overview

This project demonstrates a **modular real-time architecture**, using **tasks, queues, timers, and mutexes** for concurrent sensor data collection, telemetry transmission, and telecommand handling.

It ensures:
- Deterministic **1 Hz LoRa transmission**
- Thread-safe sensor access
- Stable synchronization across tasks and interrupts
- Structured communication between software layers

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
- LoRa E22 wireless telemetry uplink  
- GPS (NEO-6M) position and velocity tracking  
- BMP280 pressure & temperature sensing  
- MPU6050 IMU for orientation (pitch, roll, yaw)  
- Servo-based mechanical separation  
- ADC-based battery voltage monitoring  
- Mutex-protected data sharing  
- Event flag synchronization (ISR ‚Üî Tasks)  
- Layered, modular software structure
